# FIRST ASSIGNMENT - BINARY CLASSIFICATION
### TOPIC:  
Performance analysis of multiple supervised learning methods for solving a binary classification problem

### PROJECT GOAL: 
Write a python program to compare the performance of three different classification methods selected among the ones explored in our lectures (except for neural networks). 

# SECOND ASSIGNMENT - REGRESSION WITH NEURAL NETWORKS
### TOPIC: 
Developing a Neural Network for Solving a Regression Problem

### PROJECT GOAL: 
Write a python program to create and test a neural network for solving a regression problem. In your development process, you need to test multiple hyperparameters to obtain the most appropriate network for your problem. 

### DATASET: 
The dataset used in this project is the House Sales in King County, USA dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalespredictionLinks to an external site.  

This database contains data related to different houses for sale in King County, USA. The price of each house depends on a number of factors, such as the number of bedrooms and the size of the house. The aim of the project is to predict the house price based on these features.
