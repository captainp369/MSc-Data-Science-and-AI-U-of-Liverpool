# Overview
This module aims to cover the key concepts and techniques from basic calculus, linear algebra,  differential calculus, probability theory and statistics.

The acquired knowledge will help the student to interpret and analyse the results generated during data analytical processes.

 

The teaching will be done in four hematic groups in  ten weeks:

    DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS (3 weeks)
    - Review of basic calculus: numbers, sets, functions, limits,
    - basic geometry: coordinates, lines, trigonometry
    - Differential calculus: limits, continuity, derivatives, velocity, concavity
    - Optimisation: minima/maxima, gradient descent, second order methods (Newton)
   
    LINEAR ALGEBRA (2 weeks)
    - Basic concepts: vectors, matrices, dot products, matrix product
    - Geometry of matrices and derivatives, linear transformations and partial derivatives
    - Extensions: eigen values and vectors, determinants
      linear basis and projections, eigen-decomposition & SVD, pseudoinverse.

    PROBABILITY THEORY (2 weeks)
    - Basic probability: events, sample space, frequentist vs Bayesian approach,
      law of large numbers, conditional probability, independence, Bayes theorem, random variables
    - Probability distributions, probability sampling, random sampling, sampling distributions

    STATISTICS (3 weeks)
    - measures of centre and variation,
    - statistical significance (confidence intervals) and tests of hypothesis
    - errors, chi-square independence test, correlation vs causation, linear regression
    - Descriptive statistics: data and data presentation: scatter plots, line graphs, bar charts, histograms, box plots
