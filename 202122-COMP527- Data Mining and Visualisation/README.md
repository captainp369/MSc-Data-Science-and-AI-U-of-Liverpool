# Coursework 1: Perceptron algorithm
### Purpose of assessment:

The purpose of this assignment is to
demonstrate: (1) the understanding of the
Perceptron algorithm; (2) the ability to
implement the Perceptron algorithm for binary
classification; (3) the ability to evaluate a
classification algoirthm; (4) the ability to turn
a binary classification algorithm to a
multi-class classification algorithm using the
1-vs-rest approach; (4) the ability to
incorporate regularisation into classification
algorithm.

### Learning outcome assessed:

(1) A critical awareness of current problems
and research issues in data mining. (3) The
ability to consistently apply knowledge
concerning current data mining research issues
in an original manner and produce work which
is at the forefront of current developments in
the sub-discipline of data mining.

### Objectives:

This assignment requires you to implement the Perceptron algorithm using the Python
programming language.

### NOTE:

No credit will be given for implementing any other types of classification
algorithms or using an existing library for classification instead of
implementing it by yourself. However, you are allowed to use
- numpy library for accessing data structures such as numpy.array;
- random module; and
- pandas.read_csv, csv.reader, or similar modules only for reading data from the files.
However it is not a requirement of the assignment to use any of those modules.
You must provide a README file describing how to run your code to re-produce your results

# Coursework 2: k-means and k-medians algorithms
### Purpose of assessment:

The purpose of this assignment is to assess the
understanding of k-means and k-medians
clustering algorithms by implementing the
algorithms and applying them to text
clustering.

### Learning outcome assessed:

(1) A critical awareness of current problems
and research issues in data mining

### Objectives:

This assignment requires you to implement the k-means and k-medians clustering algorithms
using the Python programming language

### NOTE:

No credit will be given for implementing any other types of clustering algorithms
or using an existing library for clustering instead of implementing it by yourself.
You are allowed to use
- numpy library for accessing data structures such as numpy.array;
- random module;
- matplotlib for plotting; and
- pandas.read_csv, csv.reader, or similar modules only for reading data from the files.
However, it is not a requirement of the assignment to use any of those libraries.
You must provide a README file describing how to run your code to re-produce your results
